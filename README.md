**Hi** :wave:

In the world of computers I have yet taken interest in things like: 
* embedded development
* communication protocols
* ML, checkout my [LSTM](https://github.com/Ricardicus/recurrent-neural-net) implementation
* languages, checkout this [language](https://github.com/Ricardicus/ric-script) I am working on

Feel free to investigate my repos and please file an issue or pull request if
anything comes to mind.
